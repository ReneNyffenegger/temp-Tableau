Hyper seems to be a (data-) extract format.

Hyper is Tableau's in-memory Data Engine technology optimized for fast data
ingest and analytical query processing on large or complex data sets.

Beginning in Tableau 10.5, new extracts use the .hyper file format instead of
the .tde file format.

There is an SDK that allows to add data to a hyper file - but not to extract from it!
